## Project description

Solaris Liquidation Bot is a mechanism for detecting unhealthy obligations and liquidation them with flash loans.

In the process of work, the bot looks at the lending market of the obligations. Having found a suitable obligation, the bot sends an instruction to the liquidation program, which uses flash loans to liquidate the obligation. Liquidation income allows you to cover transaction costs as well as earn additional funds.
